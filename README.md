This is a collection of Machine Learning based tools for cosmological simulation data, written in Python.

It relies on the numerical libraries numpy, pandas, scipy and on ML standard libraries such scikit-learn, tensorflow, torch as well as the 

It is mostly tuned to work with Local Group simulations of the CLUES project (Local Group Factory, HESTIA)
