MLEKO: Machine Learning Ecosystem for KOsmology

by Edoardo Carlesi (2020), ecarlesi83@gmail.com


This is a collection of Machine Learning based tools for cosmological simulation data, written in Python.
It relies on the numerical libraries numpy, pandas, scipy and on ML standard libraries such scikit-learn, tensorflow, torch as well as the 
It is mostly tuned to work with Local Group simulations of the CLUES project (Local Group Factory, HESTIA)

Mleko means milk in Serbian, which makes the acronym sound nice to a language nerd like I am.
